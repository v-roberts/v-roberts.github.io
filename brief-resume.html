                                Studio 4: Continues the design process by examining the interactions between design and manufacturing from the designer's point of view. Common manufacturing processes will be introduced and design guidelines will be developed for each process. Emphasizes a systems engineering approach for new product development. Introduces properties of metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites. Surveys the materials available to engineers and discusses applications and material selection. Provides practice in informative, persuasive, and impromptu public speaking.
